  <summary>📚 More About Me</summary>

Basically I'm trying to stay consistent in my learning journey.
Got bored repeating the basics for too long, so on June 22, 2025, I decided to set up this GitHub and start exploring everything that excites me.
I’ve tried my hands on C, C++, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and React, and I enjoy building small projects just for fun.
I'm curious by nature, I love researching, learning new things, and writing whenever I can.
Jack of all trades, master of none — hoping one day I’ll be noticed for mastering something I truly love. Let's see where it goes.<3
